  - Each kind of tree brings its own kind of magic. . .
  - redwoods reaching into ancient sky, willows weeping beside quiet water, mesquites
    surviving sun-scorched deserts, and maples blazing in autumn like fire set to
    the wind.
  - Together, they make the world feel whole.
  - ". . . Beneath their gentle rustling and dappled light, trees remember things
    we\u2019ve long forgotten."
  - ". . . Beneath their gentle rustling and dappled light, trees remember things
    we\u2019ve long forgotten."
  - "Their roots twist deep into the dark, drinking secrets from the soil, while
    their branches stretch skyward like quiet sentinels watching the slow turning
    of the world. They will outlive us\u2014but not unkindly."
  - "They\u2019ll cradle our bones, wear our names in moss, and shelter whatever
    comes next."
